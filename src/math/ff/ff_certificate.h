Module Name:

    ff_certificate.h

Abstract:

    Format-independent ideal-membership certificates (a topologically
    ordered DAG of input/multiply/add steps) witnessing unsatisfiability of
    a system of prime-field polynomial equations, plus bounded
    reconstruction from the original equations.
